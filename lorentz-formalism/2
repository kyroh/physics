\section{The Action Functional for Fields}
In classical mechanics, the action functional \( S \) is a fundamental quantity defined as the integral over time of the Lagrangian \( L \), which encapsulates the dynamics of a system. For a system described by generalized coordinates \( q_i(t) \) and their time derivatives \( \dot{q}_i(t) \), the action is given by:

\[
S[q_i(t)] = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} L(q_i, \dot{q}_i, t) \, dt.
\]
The Lagrangian \( L \) represents the difference between the kinetic and potential energies of the system, \( L = T - V \). The principle of stationary action tells us that the actual path taken by the system between times \( t_1 \) and \( t_2 \) is the one that makes the action \( S \) stationary (usually a minimum), we can also call this the \textit{equations of motion}.

Now we will construct the action functional for classical field theories by extending the concept of discrete particles to continuous fields that permeate space and time. In field theory, the dynamical variables are fields \( \phi(x^\mu) \) that depend on spacetime coordinates \( x^\mu = (t, \mathbf{x}) \). These fields represent an infinite number of degrees of freedom, as they assign values to every point in spacetime. First we generalize the Lagrangian \( L \) to a Lagrangian density \( \mathcal{L} \), which depends on the fields \( \phi \), their spacetime derivatives \( \partial_\mu \phi \), and possibly the coordinates \( x^\mu \) themselves:

\[
\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}(\phi, \partial_\mu \phi, x^\mu).
\]
The action functional \( S \) in classical field theory is then defined as the integral of the Lagrangian density over the entire spacetime manifold:

\[
S[\phi(x^\mu)] = \int \mathcal{L}(\phi, \partial_\mu \phi, x^\mu) \, d^nx,
\]
where $d^nx$ represents $n$-dimensional spacetime. As an example, in Einsteins model of gravity we have 3 spacial dimensions and one time dimension; \( d^4x = dt \, d^3x \). The dynamics of the fields are determined by the requirement that the action \( S \) is stationary under variations of the fields \( \delta \phi \) that vanish at the boundaries of the integration domain. To derive this, we perform a variation of the action with respect to the fields \( \phi \):

\[
\delta S = \int \left( \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \phi} \delta \phi + \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial (\partial_\mu \phi)} \delta (\partial_\mu \phi) \right) d^nx.
\]
Using integration by parts on the second term and assuming that the variations \( \delta \phi \) vanish at the boundaries, we can rewrite \( \delta S \) as:

\[
\delta S = \int \left[ \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \phi} - \partial_\mu \left( \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial (\partial_\mu \phi)} \right) \right] \delta \phi \, d^4x.
\]
For the action to be stationary (\( \delta S = 0 \)) for arbitrary variations \( \delta \phi \), the integrand must vanish:

\[
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \phi} - \partial_\mu \left( \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial (\partial_\mu \phi)} \right) = 0.
\]
These are the Euler-Lagrange equations for fields, which are the equations of motion in classical field theory. They result from setting the functional derivative of the action with respect to the fields to zero:

\[
\frac{\delta S}{\delta \phi} = 0.
\]

\section*{Invariance and Covariance}
An action $S\left[\phi\right]$ is said to be invariant under a transformation if the value of the action remains unchanged when the fields $\phi(x)$ are transformed according to the transformation group. That is for transformations
\[
	x^\mu \rightarrow x^{\prime \mu} \quad \text{and} \quad
\]
